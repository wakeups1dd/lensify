Deep learning is a subset of machine learning focused on neural networks. 
GANs, also known as Generative Adversarial Networks, are used to generate realistic images. 
Transformers such as BERT and GPT models excel at language understanding. 
Loss functions include cross entropy, hinge loss, and adversarial loss.
